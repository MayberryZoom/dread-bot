const apiKeyWarning = `When you press the button below, you will be prompted by a window to provide your API key from SRC.
Please ensure you are logged into your SRC account, then follow [this link](<https://www.speedrun.com/settings/api>) and show/copy your key.

Note that anyone who gains access to this key will gain full access to your SRC account, so only post it in the pop-up window!

The bot will only use your key to check that your SRC account exists; your key is never saved. This can be verified by checking the source code [here](<https://github.com/MayberryZoom/dread-bot/blob/main/modals/srcApiKey.js>).
If you still don't feel comfortable sharing your API key, feel free to dismiss this message.`;
